hepar is a educational project of mine, to create it I used technologies like scss, react and redux.

On this app you can search recipes and sort them, choose how many outcomes you want, look up food jokes and trivia and talk to chatBot.

if app stops running its probably because api's request limits, what you need to do if that happens is - go to api.js in src files, comment active apiKey variable and uncomment another one, and you are good to go!
