hepar is a educational project of mine, to create it I used technologies like scss, react and redux.

On this app you can search recipes and choose amount of results you want. If you click on a recipe you get detailed info about it, you can check every ingredient you have and every step you make. When you go back to main page you can also click on recipes link and choose your diet, cuisine, intolerance and sort it by popularity, healthiness, time, calories, protein, energy, carbs and cholesterol. Also on the page you can find food trivia and jokes. In the right bottom corner theres a chat incon if you click it you can communicate with chatBot - ask it questions like "convert something with 2 cups of butter in grams" or "what is substitute for flour" and he will chat you back.

if app stops running its probably because api's request limits, what you need to do if that happens is - go to api.js in src files, comment active apiKey variable and uncomment another one, and you are good to go!
